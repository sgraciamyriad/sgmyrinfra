# Myriad Base Infrastructure 
- There is a specific shell script that needs to be run in addition to the original stack that creates the IAM policy/role for gocd agents (
"gocdagent.sh"
)
- This repo will be used to create the baseline infrastructure when a new account is created
- The shell script contained in this project will create the stack and update you when the task has been completed
- There will be room for VPC creation in some capacity. More infra to be added.
